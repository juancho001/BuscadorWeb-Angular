# Buscador-App

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.1.3.

## Project Description

```bash
In this section we will create our first real application with Angular. We will build a basic web search engine, this search engine will have a sidebar with the history of our searches ordered from the most recent search to our first search
```


## Update Note
```bash
Since Angular v17, by default projects work without modules (module-less), To work with a traditional way, you can implement the following command

ng new <app-name> --standalone false
```

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve -o
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Angular Help

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build or 
npm run build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
